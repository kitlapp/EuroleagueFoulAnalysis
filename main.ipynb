    "The goal of this project is to take a look at historical Euroleague data related to fouls drawn per season. We will try to give some insights and investigate if there are any specific patterns around this data. Bad referee's calls cannot be proven and the scientific approach of this project will be shaked if claiming such a thing. However, we can investigate patterns related to the general referee's decisions for each year. Additionally, this project is giving the opportunity to study some strange data cases rarely occurred through the years.\n",

    "Nikola Ivanovic has been identified as an outlier in the analysis. Ranked 30th among the most fouled players and having played only 15:21 minutes per game, Ivanovic’s value needs some study. Specifically, he very often drew approximately 10 or more fouls per 40 minutes, while staying between 9 to 17 minutes on the court. Ivanovic’s high foul rate appears to be influenced by his mediocre time on the court. As a result, his fouls-per-40-minutes value would not probably be the same, if he spent more minutes on the court. Therefore, it is likely that Ivanovic's high foul rate is a result of his adaptability to the game (approximately after 8-9 minutes on the court) and his mediocre time playing basketball (< 17 minutes). He may be highly skilled at drawing fouls when playing less than 20 minutes. However, being such an extreme outlier, even on time-normalized fouls, questioning referees decision, even if Ivanovic may be highly skilled in drawing fouls.\n",
