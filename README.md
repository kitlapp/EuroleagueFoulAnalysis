# Euroleague Foul Drawn Analysis & Application of Hypothesis Testing
May is an exciting month for Euroleague basketball, as it features the play-offs and the Final Four. As a devoted Euroleague fan, this inspired me to start this project. The project was created entirely from scratch, including data collection, which I performed manually. Additionally, it served as an excellent opportunity to apply hypothesis testing, furthering my exploration of Inferential Statistics and concluding my self-study in statistics.

The project aims to provide insights into player fouling behaviors, trends over seasons, and other related patterns. The analysis focuses on the seasons from the last Euroleague format, implemented in the 2016-2017 season to the present day. However, I have not yet collected data from all seasons. This is a large-scale project involving extensive data manipulation and visualization. It includes the following processes:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) / Descriptive Statistics
5. Application of a simple T-Hypothesis Test to compare the average scaled fouls per 40 minutes of the 2023-2024 season with the historical mean.

## DATA COLLECTION:
Foul data was collected from the following sources: 
1. https://basketnews.com/leagues/25-euroleague/statistics.html
2. https://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague/?geoip=disabled

The data was organized and stored in Excel files for analysis.

## FILES INCLUDED:
1. Foul data files from the last 5 seasons in .xlsx form X 5
2. Visualizations in .png form X 21
3. The core project .ipynb main file X 1
4. The README file

## HOW TO SET UP THE ENVIRONMENT
1. Download the project as a zip file or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Anaconda Prompt and type:
   --> conda create --name 'YourEnvName' python=3.11.9 pandas=2.2.1 numpy=1.26.4 matplotlib=3.8.4 seaborn=0.12.2 scipy=1.13.0 plotly=5.22.0 jupyter=1.0.0 -c conda-forge
3. Activate the newly-created environment.
4. Launch Jupyter via Anaconda Prompt.
5. Open the project's Jupyter named 'main'.
6. Enjoy!
