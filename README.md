# euroleague_fouls  
May is a Euroleague basketball competition month as it includes play-offs and the final four. As a devoted Euroleague fan, this period motivated me to start this project. In contrast to my previous projects, this created entirely from scratch in terms of the idea and the way the idea is expressed throughout the project. In addition, it was a great opportunity to apply hypothesis testing continuing to demonstrate some Inferential Statistics concepts (I presented the application of confidence intervals in my previous project "confidence_intervals").

The project aims to provide insights into player fouling behaviors, trends over seasons, etc. The analysis includes only the seasons of the last Euroleague format, which applies from the season 2016-2017 to this day. However, I have not yet collected the data from all seasons. This is a large project where a lot of data frames and visualizations have been created. It needed Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering and Exploratory Data Analysis-Descriptive Statistics. Additionally, I applied a simple T-Hypothesis Test in the average scaled fouls per 40 minutes per season to compare the historical mean with the season's 2023-2024 mean.

Files included in this repo:
1) There are 5 Excel Datafiles from Euroleague seasons 2019-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023, 2023-2024.
2) The Jupyter Notebook where my project is developped.

Data Collection:
I collected the foul data from https://basketnews.com/leagues/25-euroleague/statistics.html and https://www.euroleaguebasketball.net/euroleague/?geoip=disabled sites, organizing them in Excel files.

What I gained from this project:
1) I applied my knowledge for the first time to a domain that I have expertise and I am completely enjoying being busy with.
2) All done from scratch: Data Collection, the development of thinking concepts throughout the project, the application of T-Test, etc.
3) Given the opportunity to apply Feature Engineering in my data understanding that total fouls per season consist of raw data which should be appropriately scaled. 
4) I completed my Inferential Statistics studies practically applying a hypothesis test into the data.

I hope you will enjoy it!

Thank you!
